# Employee Info Tracker

## Purpose
For this challenge, I wanted to create a command-line application that allows an employer to keep track of all their employees and their departments, roles, managers, and salaries. From the command line, a user simply starts the application with typing node index.js. A welcome message and a menu with different choices will pop up. The user can choose to view departments, view roles, view employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, update an employee role, delete an employee, or view a department's budget. Once the user has chosen, they will either be shown a table with information for prompts that allow them to update or delete information. After the user has completed their task, the main menu will reappear where they can choose another task or end their session.
